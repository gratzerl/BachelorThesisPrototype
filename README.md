This repository contains the code for a kitchen display prototype developed for my bachelor thesis.
This kitchen display is used in kitchens and bars to display incoming orders.
Chefs are able to check finished dishes and tables.

This implementation should demonstrate how an existing VB application could be implemented using 
React and GraphQL.
